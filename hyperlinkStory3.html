    <h1>The time I... was stranded</h1>
    <h3>By: Kaitlyn Rice</h3>
    <p>The flight was long and uneventful, but once we got off the plane we immediately got our car and drove to the blue lagoon.</p>
    <p>During our roadtrips around parts of the island, we picked up many hitchhikers along the way:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 guys from America (Colorado and Vermont)</li>
        <li>A couple from Ukraine</li>
        <li>Group from the Czech Republic working there over the summer</li>
    </ul>
    <p>On our last full day, we did an ATV excursion around the countryside where we visited gysters and learned more about their geothermal power production.</p>
    <p>Sadly, it came time for us to <a href="hyperlinkStory3.5.html">leave</a> the beautiful island of Iceland.</p>
