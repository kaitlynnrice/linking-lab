    <h1>The time I... </h1>
    <h3>By: Kaitlyn Rice</h3>
    <div><b>Summer 2018</b><br></div>
    <div><b>3 weeks before</b></div>
    <p>One random day, I recieved a phone call from my Aunt. I figued it would be just a quick catchup; the classic "how was finals?" and "have any plans this summer?". Instead, I was met with her explaining that she had a work trip coming up and both her husband and son were busy during that time - my aunt doesn't like traveling alone.</p>
    <p>The call continues with her giving details on this trip:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>July 2 - July 6:</b> Reykjavik, Iceland</li>
        <li><b>July 6 - July 11:</b> Stockholm, Sweden</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Luckily I had gotten my passport that same year, so that wouldn't be an issue. The caveat was I would have to fly back from Sweden alone. I had never flown alone let alone flown to another country. That wasn't going to stop me, so of course I told her I would come along. Who would pass up an opportunity to go abroad?</p>
