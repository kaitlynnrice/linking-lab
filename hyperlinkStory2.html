    <h1>The time I... was</h1>
    <h3>By: Kaitlyn Rice</h3>
    <p>Not having a lot of time to prepare, I immediately start getting my shifts at work covered, pulled out my winter clothes, and started packing. The weirdest part was I was packing for 2 different climates. Summer in Iceland is still very cold, but in Sweden it was the opposite.</p>
    <p>My aunt and I were had a direct flight from Seattle to Reykjavik, about 7.5 hours. We planned out our trip so we could maximize the 5 days we were there.</p>
    <p>Our itinerary included:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Blue Lagoon</li>
        <li>Golden Circle</li>
        <li>South coast to Vik</li>
        <li>West Iceland</li>
        <li>ATV Tour</li>
    </ul>
