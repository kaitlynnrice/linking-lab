    <h1>The time I... was stranded</h1>
    <h3>By: Kaitlyn Rice</h3>
    <p>The next leg of the trip was to Stolkholm, Sweden!</p>
    <p>We did some sightseeing around the city, visited some museums, and even went inside of a castle! However, the main reason for the trip was for a work conference in Stolckholm. Which meant that I would be along for part of the trip. I spent a lot of time walking around looking in the local shops and buying some momentos for myself, friends, and family.</p>
    <p>The trip went by quickly and as soon as I knew it I was driving to the airport... to fly for the first time alone.</p>
