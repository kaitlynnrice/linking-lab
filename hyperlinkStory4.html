    <h1>The time I... was stranded abroad</h1>
    <h3>By: Kaitlyn Rice</h3>
    <p>After a very eventful and fun filled trip, it was time for me to head back home solo. My aunt dropped me off at the Stolkholm airport and I navigated my way through security and make my way toward my gate. As soon as I arrived, we were notifed that we were being delayed for our flight back to Reykjavik.</p>
    <p>I had a very short layover in Iceland before getting on my fight back to America. I was a stressed. I let my family know what was going on and we all were hoping for the best.</p>
    <p>I found out later that my parents and aunt had already begun sorting out a plan A, B, C, D... of what would happen if I was stranded in a foreign country alone. My only job at that point was to high tail myself over to the gate ASAP.</p>
    <p>On the flight the Captain had said over the loud speaker, "All passengers going to Portland, Las Vegas, St. Louis, and Washington will be let off the plane first and escorted to their gates. All planes going to those places are on standby waiting." I let out a sigh of relief, I was going to be okay.</p>
    <p>Until I wasn't and figured out he had meant Washington D.C not Washington state. Once again I was filled with stress. I finally got off the plane and bolted to customs. Once I got through customs, I checked the time and it was already time for take off. With the last shred of hope, I ran up the stairs and through the airport (I assume looking insane)...</p>
